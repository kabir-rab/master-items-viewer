# master-items-viewer
Displays master dimensions and master measures with expressions and descriptions. This allows users to search the master items description or expression.

# Dimensional Score Card
## _When using it for the first time - you will have to reload the page on browser after adding on the extension to display the measures and dimensions._
_There is a clash with master items on Qlik Sense client hence the refresh. I will look at alternative way to do this to avoid this I think._
